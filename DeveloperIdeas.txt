       -- aesthetic: smoothnessis a motif: upper city docks are made of wood, made of a light wood and more open housing plans, lots of open windows and such. Water snakes its way around the houses and docking areas, making sprialesc tunnels and flowing waterfalls in air. Underwater city have more smooth amorphous housing plans, houses shaped like water droplets in a way, of smoothed down stone and with accents of light and dark blue. Purple is used in especially upper class living spaces, seens as a symmbol of wealth and culturally significant
